<a id="the-cable-bible" class="anchor" href="#the-cable-bible" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Cable Bible</h1>

<p>A comprehensive guide to cables and connectors potentially used for audiovisual/media preservation. Cable types and connectors are organized by the primary purpose of the signal being transferred - video, audio-only, data (i.e. computer cables) and power. Examples of physical connectors, pinouts and contextual uses for each kind of cable are nested within descriptions of signal types, wiring, interfaces and protocols!</p>

<p>Please feel free to clone this repository or create a new branch with your own additions of signal types, interfaces or connectors you think we're missing (there's a lot!). There are already some checklists under the <a href="https://github.com/amiaopensource/cable-bible/issues">Issue</a> page that show what at least needs to be filled in from the current TOC. Submit a pull request so that someone can review your changes and make sure that everything remains at least somewhat orderly - or if you're not so comfortable with github but have photos or information that you think should be added, please submit an issue and I'll update when I can!</p>

<h3>
<a id="analog" class="anchor" href="#analog" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Analog</h3>

<p>Analog audiovisual media record image and sound information as a continuous signal stored in or on the media itself (in the case of most "video" formats, as a continually fluctuating level of magnetic field strength on tape). Different types of video processing can allow that signal to be carried along different channels, with each channel representing a different portion of the video information (e.g. luminance/brightness, chrominance/color, sync). The types of cable you will need to work with an analog video signal will depend primarily on how these channels have been divided, as well as considerations of signal-to-noise ratio - all analog signals are subject to some degree of electronic noise or distortion, and different connection standards and interfaces have been developed to combat such signal degradation.  </p>

<h4>
<a id="composite" class="anchor" href="#composite" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Composite</h4>

<p>In composite cables, all video information (including both luminance and chrominance) is encoded on to a single channel/wire. As all information is traveling along one channel, composite video is the most susceptible to noise in the signal.  </p>

<p><strong>Introduced:</strong> 1956<br>

<h4>
<a id="component-ypbpr" class="anchor" href="#component-ypbpr" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Component YPbPr</h4>

<p>YPbPr signal is often referred to, imprecisely, simply as "component" video, although there are actually several standards of component video (any signal standard that splits video information into multiple channels is component, including S-Video and the multiple RGB standards). In YPbPr, the video signal is split into three channels: Y (containing luminance and sync), Pb (the difference between blue and luma), and Pr (the difference between red and luma). The remaining (green) chrominance information is derived from the relationship between these three signals. YPbPr cables are sometimes referred to as "yipper" cables and are connectors are usually color-coded (Y=green, Pb=blue, Pr=red); however YPbPr cables are fundamentally wired the same as composite cables and can be used interchangeably as long as the corresponding ports are properly connected.</p>

<h4>
<a id="s-video" class="anchor" href="#s-video" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>S-Video</h4>

<p>S-Video (sometimes known as "separate video") cables carry video over two synchronized signal channels: Y (luma) and C (chroma, including saturation and hue). It can achieve better image quality than composite but lower color resolution than component RGB or YPbPr video.

<h4>
<a id="rgbs" class="anchor" href="#rgbs" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>RGBS</h4>

<p>A component video standard in which luminance and chrominance information is encoded into three channels (red, green and blue) and a fourth is used for composite sync (vertical and horizontal sync encoded together on the same wire). RGBS utilizes no compression and has no particular limit on color depth or resolution, but requires a high bandwidth as the three channels carry much redundant information (i.e. the same black-and-white luma information repeated three times). Extremely common in European equipment (especially monitors), rare elsewhere.  </p>

<h3>
<a id="digital" class="anchor" href="#digital" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Digital</h3>

<p>As opposed to <a href="README.md#analog">analog video</a>, in digital recording the video and/or audio signal is converted into a stream of numbers (bits), that collectively represent the luminance, chrominance, and other values that make up the image. The stream must be converted back into analog waveforms to be viewed on a monitor/video screen. Provided electrical noise is not too great, it will theoretically not affect the quantification of the signal. Different standards for digital video and audio have developed in order to make it possible to pass more information along one connection in the same (or shorter) amount of time (also to make it possible to send audio information along the same cable/connection as video).  </p>

<h4>
<a id="sdi" class="anchor" href="#sdi" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>SDI</h4>

<p>Serial Digital Interface (SDI) actually refers to a family of SMPTE interface standards designed for the transmission of uncompressed, unencrypted digital video signals. The original standard ("SD-SDI"), defined for 480i and 576i standard definition video, has been periodically updated (e.g. HD-SDI, 6G-SDI) to allow for steadily increasing bit rates, frame rates, video resolutions, etc. Because SDI is an unencypted digital signal, it has generally been restricted from use in consumer equipment, and is usually found in professional, broadcast-grade production and preservation environments.</p>

<p><strong>Introduced:</strong> 1989<br>
<strong>Max resolution and data rate:</strong> As of 2015, the 12G-SDI standard allows up to 2160p60 video at 12 Gb/s<br>
<strong>Connectors and ports:</strong>  </p>

<a id="firewire" class="anchor" href="#firewire" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>FireWire</h4>

<p>IEEE 1394, referred to as "FireWire," was developed by Apple as an interface for high-speed data transfer (see: <a href="README.md#firewire-1">FireWire</a> section under Data signals). However the FireWire interface was also employed by digital cameras recording to tape media with the DV (Digital Video) protocol (e.g. MiniDV, DVCAM, DVCPRO). Some camcorders were also able to directly output a DV signal to a digital video recorder or computer via a FireWire cable/interface.  When used with digital video, the FireWire interface operates at a slower data rate than in most of its data transfer applications.<br>

<h3>
<a id="analog-1" class="anchor" href="#analog-1" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Analog</h3>

<p>Unlike analog video, analog audio signals are essentially only ever transferred over one channel (i.e. one-track monaural/"mono") or two (two-track mono, or stereo). Analog audio cables, generally speaking, thus only had to carry one channel of audio and two cables would simply be employed for recording or reproducing two-track mono or stereo (in contrast to the proliferation of standards and cables for video - composite, S-Video, RBG, etc). The most critical characteristic in regard to analog audio cabling, then (beyond connector types), regards balanced vs. unbalanced wiring, a method employed to reduce noise interference in audio cables.  </p>

<h4>
<a id="balanced" class="anchor" href="#balanced" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Balanced</h4>

<p>Balanced coaxial audio cables contain three wires: "earth" (electrical ground), "hot" (positive audio signal), and "cold" (negative audio signal). The audio signal is transferred on both the hot and cold lines, but the voltage in the cold line is inverted (i.e. signal is negative when the hot line's is positive, and vice versa). When the cable is plugged into an input, the hot and cold signals are mixed together, but the cold signal is also inverted again. This has the effect of strengthening the original, recorded audio signal (doubling the number of wires it was carried on) while also canceling out the signal of any unintentional noise in the signal picked up as the audio traveled over the cable. (Since that noise was essentially "recorded" positively on to both the hot and cold lines, flipping the polarity of the cold line at input gives you exact opposite noise signals, which cancel each other out)  </p>

<p>Reducing analog audio noise is an issue primarily with longer cables, or in professional/broadcast or preservation environments, where the absolute integrity of the audio signal is more highly valued than on consumer equipment.  </p>

<a id="optical" class="anchor" href="#optical" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Optical</h5>

<p>Fiber optic cables transmit data signals as flashes of light over flexible, transparent fibers made of glass or plastic. In audio applications, they can allow transmission at higher bandwidths without the electromagnetic interference to which metal wires are susceptible. Due to attenuation (the reduction of the intensity of the light over distance), consumer-grade optical audio cables are generally short (5-10 meters).  </p>

<a id="midi" class="anchor" href="#midi" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>MIDI</h4>

<p>Short for Musical Instrument Digital Interface, a standard usually used for connecting a wide variety of musical instruments and/or computers to each other. MIDI links allow for the transmission of up to 16 channels of information at a time (although only in one direction, so separate cables are required for input/output). Technically speaking, MIDI does not actually carry digital audio - it carries event information that specifies control parameters such as pitch, notation, volume, vibrato, clock signals and other metadata to synchronize audio/musical devices with each other. MIDI is usually employed fairly exclusively in production/recording envrionments.  </p>

<a id="parallel" class="anchor" href="#parallel" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Parallel</h3>

<p>Digital transmission can occur in one of two basic methods: parallel or serial communication. In parallel communication, multiple bits (usually 8 bits, otherwise known as one byte) are transferred simultaneously on separate channels within the same cable, then combined and synchronized. This can result in a faster bit rate than serial transmission, but is also significantly more expensive (since it requires far more wires to create the cable) and the synchronization timing in parallel transmission is also susceptible to distance, making it impractical for longer cables. Parallel communication was popular in the 1980s but has generally fallen out of favor in modern data transmission.   </p>

<p>Referred to alternately as SCSI (Small Computers Systems Interface) Parallel Interface, SPI, or before the advent of <a href="README.md#serial-scsi">Serial SCSI</a>, simply SCSI (pronounced "scuzzy"). Unfortunately, Parallel SCSI is not technically a single standard, but a series of almost a dozen related interfaces with ambiguous names ("Fast SCSI", "Ultra SCSI," etc.) and variable bit depths and rates. See the link to a comparison table below. In any case, Parallel SCSI cables were used to connect peripheral devices to computers; unlike PATA, which could only connect a maximum of two devices, a single Parallel SCSI data bus could be attached to up to 8 or 16 devices. The symbol below generally marked a SCSI port on computers.  </p>

<em>50-pin micro-ribbon</em><br>
Micro ribbon or miniature ribbon connectors have a similar shielded design to the D-sub family of connectors, but used a different kind of contact known as ribbon contacts rather than pin contacts. There are various configurations that were used with Parallel SCSI but the most common variety was a 50-contact micro-ribbon connector. These connectors were often referred to by the brand name of the company that manufactured them: for instance, Amphenol-50, IDC-50, CN-50 (Centronics).  </p>

<p>A standard for parallel communication alternately, and more commonly, referred to as "parallel port", "printer port" or the "Centronics port", as it was originally developed by Centronics to facilitate communication between computers and Centronics-brand dot-matrix printers. Originally unidirectional ("send-only") for sending data from a computer to a printer, but later developed to allow for bidirectional communication, it became a popular alternative to Parallel SCSI for peripherals like floppy drives and network adapters and hard drives as it had cheaper circuitry.

<h3>
<a id="serial" class="anchor" href="#serial" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Serial</h3>

<p>As opposed to <a href="README.md#parallel">parallel transmission</a>, in serial communication bits are transferred sequentially over the same wire. Bytes must be assembled and sent as a unit and then disassembled by the receiving device. Though serial data transmission was developed before parallel transmission, parallel communication reigned for much of the late 1970s-1980s as physical performance limitations originally gave parallel communication higher data rates. Improvements in cable and circuit design have since made serial transmission the far faster and preferred option.  </p>

<p>Because it was the first serial data protocol to become a standard feature in personal computing, RS-232 was commonly referred to simply as "the serial port." It was used for bidirectional connection to many peripheral computer devices, including modems, printers, mice, external drives, etc. It was also used for remote connection and control of some VTRs. It is referred to as "RS" because it was originally sponsored by the Radio Sector of the Electronic Industries Association - changes in the sponsoring organization have caused the standard to be alternately referred to as EIA-232 and TIA-232. The symbol below generally marked serial port connections on computers.  </p>

<a href="pinouts.md#usb-31"><em>Type C</em></a><br>
A reversible, symmetrical design capable of carrying data at 10 Gbit/s (between two USB 3.1-compatible devices), power, and built-in support for DisplayPort video and four channels of audio. Increasingly found as a charging/data port for PC laptops and Apple laptops via the <a href="README.md#thunderbolt-3">ThunderBolt</a> protocol.  </p>

<a id="firewire-1" class="anchor" href="#firewire-1" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>FireWire</h4>

<p>Developed by Apple at roughly the same time as <a href="README.md#usb">USB</a>, for the similar purpose of consolidating connections and improving data transfer speeds. Unlike USB, FireWire does not require the use of a host controller (FireWire-compatible devices can communicate directly to each other without the use of a computer), but it was more costly to implement than USB and therefore never quite as popular. Sometimes referred to as i.Link (in Sony applications) and Lynx (Texas Instruments), as FireWire is technically just the Apple branding of the IEEE 1394 standard. Used for connections to external hard drives, as well as A/V component communication and control. Two major flavors of FireWire were introduced before Apple phased out development of the standard in favor of <a href="README.md#thunderbolt">ThunderBolt</a>. Ports usually represented by the symbol below.  </p>

<h4>
<a id="thunderbolt" class="anchor" href="#thunderbolt" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>ThunderBolt</h4>

<p>Developed by Apple as a replacement for <a href="README.md#firewire-1">FireWire</a>. Combines computer bus data transmission with the DisplayPort digital video interface, as well as DC power, all over one cable/connection. The first two major versions of ThunderBolt shared a physical connector and had compatible wiring/channels, but the introduction of ThunderBolt 3 has been marked by major shifts in physical interface. Ports usually labelled by the symbol below.  </p>
